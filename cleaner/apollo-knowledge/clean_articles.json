You want to engage with net new contacts that have matched the criteria in your saved search in the last 24 hours. In this search, you might want to view the contact owner, the lead status, and the date they entered the pipeline.\nNow let's say you are a sales leader. You have asked your team to create a list of the contacts they will invite to an upcoming webinar. In this case, you might want your reps to view a table layout that includes contact status, SDR owner, account tier, and perhaps a custom field for subscription status.\n \nWhat If I'm Not an Admin?\nPlease note, you don't need admin access to create and apply custom layouts to your searches. However, only admin users can create public custom table layouts and access the \"table layouts\" tab in the settings. If you have a great idea for a new table layout for your entire team but don't have admin access, reach out to your team's admin users to make the magic happen.\nRefer to the sections below to create new custom layouts, manage your layouts in the settings, and apply a custom layout when prospecting.",

Now, it accurately reflects the right action for the play.\n- Caught the Mailgun integration showing off in the settings and confusing users who don't have access. Taught it to be more humble. Now, it only shows up where it's invited.\n- Net new contacts were getting left behind when users tried adding them to an Outreach sequence.

Now, when you enroll new contacts into follow-up sequences via the Gmail extension, Apollo automatically saves the contact first.\n- Reprimanded the LinkedIn automation feature for being so overdramatic. Now, instead of abandoning all tasks when it encounters a 404 page, it switches to the next task after 60 seconds.\n- Some Salesforce accounts were duplicated when the records were saved in Apollo. We told the sync off for getting carried away and de-duplicated all the affected accounts.\n- Taught a taciturn error message a lesson in communication. Now, it shares a more detailed description explaining why users receive an error if they try to link integrations in Godmode.\n- Added an automatic redirect to squash the Google-specific error that prevented some users from connecting their Gmail mailboxes.\n- Told the Apollo pull settings not to give up so easily. Now, it identifies and retries any unsynced Salesforce tasks until they are successfully pulled from Salesforce.\n- Treated the Plays \"Sort by\" filter for temporary amnesia. Now, the default \"sort by\" option is set to \"Last modified,\" and if you make any changes to the setting, they save without an issue.",

You can call contacts within LinkedIn, Google Calendar, Salesforce, Gmail—or quite frankly, any webpage that tickles your fancy.\nUse the Apollo Chrome extension to find your ideal contacts, access their numbers, and then call them right away while their profile is still fresh in your mind.

Please bear with us while we fine-tune the magic formula. Alternatively, if you're feeling the icy effects of FOMO, reach out to the Apollo Support Team to join in on the beta warm-up action.\nBefore you start sending outbound emails at scale in Apollo, consider warming up your connected mailboxes first. Mailbox warm-up helps you generate consistent email activity and encourages SPAM filters to deem your account trustworthy. This increases your sender score, improves your email deliverability, and ultimately empowers you to convert more contacts into closed deals.\n \nWhoah! Slow Down, Maurice—What's a Sender Score?\nThe sender score is a number from 0-100 that represents the quality of your sender reputation. It measures the performance of your IP address and represents the health of your mailbox through the eyes of mailbox providers. The lower your score, the harder it is to ensure your emails land in your contacts' inboxes—safe and sound. 0 is the worst score. 100 is the best. A score of 80+ is the sweet spot you should aim for to increase your chances of avoiding that dreaded SPAM folder.\nWhen you opt-in to Apollo's mailbox warm-up, you join a pool of fellow Apollo users who also care about email deliverability. You can select how many emails you send and receive daily from within our mail-warming network. Then, we'll automate the process.\nThe Apollo mailbox warm-up tool mimics human behavior to ensure your email activity appears authentic. Once you opt-in, we automatically send, open, mark as important, remove from SPAM, and reply to a percentage of the mail-warming emails we send via your mailbox.\nRefer to the steps below to opt-in to Apollo mailbox warm-up, configure the settings, and create a mail-warming rule in your email inbox.\n \nIt's One Part of the Potion\nPlease note, raising your sender score through mail warming is an important step, but it is not the only piece of the outbound mastery puzzle. For more information about other email best practices that keep your domain reputation safe and your email deliverability rates high, refer to the \" Avoid SPAM Filters \" article. And if you're in the mood for a little extra reading, hop into the \" Email Verification: A Brief Introduction \" article to learn more about email verification best practices.",

    "body": "Developers by day, pest control by night. Here are the latest bugs we've squashed:\n- Told off the Net New tab on the People Search page for displaying the Salesforce button when you can only add saved contacts to Salesforce. It apologized. Now, the Salesforce button is only visible on the Saved tab.\n- Told the ownership field to quit being so possessive. Now, users can change owners without any issues before pushing a record to Salesforce.\n- Visited lost and found to retrieve the correct HubSpot mapping logic. Now, you can push any contact with an email address to HubSpot without issues.\n- Politely asked our Salesforce mapping logic to make an exception to the rules. Now, you can push a contact without an associated account, provided it has mapped account fields.\n- Told our APIs not to discriminate when syncing email replies from Microsoft mailboxes. Now, all Microsoft mailboxes will sync with Apollo, including the latest MS versions.\n- Taught our Salesloft mapping logic to multitask. And voila! You can now push both mobile and corporate numbers to the corresponding fields in Salesloft without beef.\n- Gave the stage filter on the tasks page a lesson in basic math. Now, it's top of the class and displays the correct number of total contacts in each stage.\n- Sneaky replies were falling through the cracks. We taught Apollo's email tracking to be more vigilant. Now, when a contact replies, Apollo catches the response and finishes the sequence accordingly.\n- Asked the create a sequence page to compose itself when users try to add a LinkedIn step into the sequence. It no longer crashes with excitement and now adds the \"interact with a LinkedIn post\" step without issues.",

For example, if you have just had a demo with a team and are following up to try and close the deal, your messaging should differ greatly from if a contact has been ghosting you for the past 2 weeks. For the steps to create new sequences, refer to the Create a Sequence article. If you're looking for some helpful tips to create powerful messaging for your sequences, hop into the Craft Killer Sales Email Messaging article.\nTo view a brief outline of the steps in the selected sequence, click See steps .\nClick View sequence in Apollo if you want to take a closer look at the sequence or make any edits before enrolling the contacts from your email.\nApollo populates your default mailbox in the Send emails from: drop-down. To make changes, click the drop-down and select an alternative mailbox.\n \nIn the Mood for More Mailboxes?\nWondering how to connect additional mailboxes? Jump on into the Link Your Mailbox to Apollo article for more details. However, please note that you can only connect more than 1 mailbox per user if you are on a Professional or Custom Apollo plan.\nIf you have multiple recipients in the email, you can choose who you make the Primary contact.\n \nHold the Phone—What Does That Mean?\nWhen you add multiple recipients to a follow-up sequence, only the primary contact appears in the \"contact\" and \"email\" tabs within the sequence in Apollo.\nBut don't panic—the other recipients are still within sight! Apollo displays the email in the activity feed on a contact's profile page.\nApollo also uses the primary contact at the sequence ruleset level. For example, if you set the sequence to finish when a contact responds, Apollo only stops the sequence if the primary contact responds. For more information about how sequence rulesets work, please refer to the Create a Sequence Ruleset article.\nTo change the primary contact, hover your mouse over the contact name. Then, click Set primary .\n \nOne at a Time, Folks!\nPlease note, you cannot set the same primary contact in more than one email thread per sequence. You also cannot add the same email thread to more than one follow-up sequence at a time.\nIf you want to remove any recipients from the follow-up sequence, click the checkbox to the left of a contact's name. You cannot uncheck the primary contact.\nClick Set follow-up to enroll the contacts in the follow-up sequence immediately.\nAlternatively, click Schedule follow-up if you want to schedule the sequence for later.\nThen, click the radio button next to your preferred scheduled time or manually select a custom date and time for the follow-up sequence to begin.\nClick Schedule .\nYou have now added the recipients from your email into a follow-up sequence.\nIf the first step in your follow-up sequence is an automatic email, Apollo sends the message within the same email thread in Gmail.\n \nWatch Your Step!\nPlease note, if the first step in your follow-up sequence is any other task, such as a manual email, LinkedIn task, or call, Apollo displays the next steps in your Apollo tasks. Please check the Tasks tab in the Apollo app to continue with the next steps in the follow-up sequence.",

Here are the latest bugs we've squashed:\n- Told the misbehaving HTML tags on the notes section of each call to render correctly.\n- Unlinked mailboxes were suffering from FOMO and delivering emails through SendGrid despite being unlinked. They saw the error of their ways. Now, only linked mailboxes can send emails through SendGrid.\n- Cured the permission profile settings of temporary amnesia. Now, any changes you make will save without a problem.\n- The search feature in the calls tab was obsessed with anonymity. We got to the bottom of its identity issues. Now, you can once again search for calls using contact names.\n- Gave the email composer a dose of formatting therapy to put an end to the color chaos it caused when users tried to change the color of one word in an email.\n- The sender's email ID had separation anxiety when users tried to reply to an email within a thread. We gave it a dose of therapy. It no longer appears in the \"Send To\" field. Instead, it stays in the \"Send From\" field, where it belongs.\n- Told the Apollo-Salesforce pull logic to stop feeling shy when users pulled new phone numbers into Apollo from Salesforce. Now, the pull logic welcomes your synced Salesforce phone numbers like a true host should and prioritizes them over any enriched numbers in Apollo.\n- Let our Apollo-HubSpot push workers know that this town ain't big enough for duplicates. Now, it cross-references to prevent the pushing of duplicate accounts.\n- Gave our Salesforce pull cadence a makeover to ensure Salesforce fields populate correctly in Apollo.\n- Urged the Salesforce integration to be more lenient. Now, even if there is no account present for a contact, you can still push the field to Salesforce.\n- Taught the CRM Enrichment feature a lesson in communication. Now, if you need to update your plan or purchase an add-on to access the feature, Apollo displays a message so you know why and how to access it.",

Now, you can see all email logs in the CRM sync history for both successful and failed pushes.\n- When users with Microsoft mailboxes sent emails outside of Apollo, their emails were not pushed to their CRMs. We decided that would not do.\n- Now—provided a user has enabled the right settings—Apollo pushes all external emails sent and received from their Microsoft mailbox into their team's CRM.\n- Users could not see all available \"send-from\" mailboxes when pushing contacts into Salesloft cadences.\n- We updated the integration to request a smaller API payload from Salesloft. And voila! All mailboxes are now visible.\n- Users on HubSpot-connected teams could not push existing accounts if a new HubSpot admin joined the team.\n- We updated the reconnection logic. Now, provided the new admin exists in the same HubSpot instance as the previously connected one, you can push existing records, no problemo!\n- The manual push worker was refusing to push records to users' CRMs in bulk if they had previously configured stage restrictions.\n- We taught the push worker not to be so obstinate. Now, when you select and push contacts and accounts to your CRM in bulk, Apollo bypasses the stage restrictions and executes the push successfully.\n- Some rebellious text was spilling into the wrong feature set in the Apollo integration settings.\n- We put it in its place. Now, the text is back where it should be and calm has been restored.",

We gave it a good talking to and updated the call-back function. Now, you can filter account views from Salesforce to your heart's content in Apollo.\n- The Apollo<>Mailgun integration was visible for some free trial users but they were unable to connect their accounts. As the feature is only available to users on a paid plan, we taught the integration a lesson in manners and updated the feature gate within the settings. Now, only users on a paid plan can view the integration and connect Mailgun with Apollo.\n- We put an end to the issue that prevented HubSpot-connected teams with custom user lookup fields from viewing and selecting users from their HubSpot instance. How you may ask? We updated the fields to query HubSpot's new API and formatted the API calls based on HubSpot owners and users. And Huzzah—the magic formula worked a charm!\n- The front and back ends of the HubSpot CRM Enrichment feature were falling out of touch. We organized a reunion to rekindle the flame of collaboration. Now, when you save your auto-fill or auto-overwrite settings, the UI will reflect your saved settings correctly.",

You need to make sure you deliver the right message, to the right people, at the right time, and to the right email domain.\nEmail verification is an essential cog in the motion of any email engagement workflow. It is the process of validating the authenticity and accuracy of an email address before you send any messages to your ideal contacts .\nThere are many advantages to email verification, including:\n- Protect the health and reputation of your email domain\n- Increase your email delivery rates and ensure your message reaches the right people in the right inboxes\n- Identify stale data before you message contacts on outdated or invalid email addresses that can harm your domain reputation and decrease your engagement rates\n- Reduce the risk of being flagged as SPAM\nRefer to the sections below for more information about how email verification tools work and what catch-all emails mean for your campaigns.",

    "heading_id": "toc_2",
    "body": "Many people use email verification tools such as ZeroBounce, Mailfloss, Neverbounce, or Hunter to help protect their domain reputation and increase the performance of their email campaigns. However, if you use a third-party email verification tool in conjunction with Apollo, it can often be counterproductive to the success of your sequences .\nEvery third-party email verification tool has developed its own process to verify your emails. This means that the effectiveness or reliability of email verification relies greatly on the specific process of the tool you choose. Most competent tools include steps such as:\n- A syntax check to ensure there are no typos or questionable characters in the email address\n- A domain check to verify the existence of the domain name on which the email is hosted\n- An email ping to check that the specific email address exists\nAlthough these techniques can be effective, they can also greatly affect your coverage. For example, if an email service is temporarily unreachable when the verification tool checks its domain, you exclude all the emails from an organization in one swift check.\nFurthermore, the majority of popular email verification tools use a method called SMTP tickling.\n \nHold the Phone, What's that?\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for sending messages. Most email verification tools leverage SMTP tickling to ask an email service if an email exists, thereby verifying its validity before you send any messages to it.\nSMTP tickling does not differentiate between valid and invalid \" catch-all emails \". Therefore, this method does not confirm if the email address will link you to the right person, or if your messages will be auto-dumped into a default inbox that no one will see.\n \nIt's Not All Doom and Gloom\nAlthough catch-all domains can still lead you to the right person; when you use third-party verification tools, is it very difficult to guarantee that they will. Hop into the Email Verification: The Apollo Process article to learn more about how Apollo's robust, built-in email verification process helps you to overcome this issue.\nFinally, it's important to note that a third-party tool is not an all-encompassing solution. Several factors impact your bounce rate, some of which email verification tools cannot help you with. For more information, refer to the \" Email Accuracy \" section of the \"Email Verification: The Apollo Process\" article.\nRead on to find out more about what catch-all emails are and why they matter.",

    "body": "Catch-all emails are the email addresses that belong to a catch-all mail server. This means that if you send an email to any address that belongs to a specific domain name—even if the address does not exist, or is written incorrectly—the catch-all mail server accepts your email.\n \nIt's Polyonymous!\nYou may have heard of the terms \"accept-all emails\" or \"wildcard email aliases\" too. Fear not, observant souls—catch-all emails go by many names but the same definition applies to them all.\nHere's an example of how catch-all emails can be problematic for your campaigns:\nDomain Name\nExisting Email Addresses from Example Domain\nCatch-All Inbox\nInvalid Email Address\nexampledomain.com\nbob@exampledomain.com, jane@exampledomain.com, craig@exampledomain.com, tim@exampledomain.com\ninfo@exampledomain.com\nterry@exampledomain.com\nYou have an email for Terry at Example. His email is terry@exampledomain.com . However, Terry stopped working at Example 1 month ago and the company is yet to replace him. Example has 4 existing employee email addresses, plus 1 catch-all email address. This means that even though Terry left the company and his email address is no longer valid, the message you send to terry@exampledomain.com will land in the catch-all info@exampledomain.com inbox.\nCatch-all email servers exist so that important emails still reach a company inbox, despite sender errors. For this reason, a large number of companies have a catch-all email server. However, with the rise in spammers taking advantage of catch-all email domains, only some companies still dedicate resources to keep on top of reviewing the emails in their catch-all inboxes.\nIn short, if no one checks this catch-all inbox regularly, chances are the emails that land there won't be seen by anyone, let alone opened or read by the specific person you are trying to reach.",

    "body": "Third-party email verification tools sometimes flag Apollo-verified emails as invalid. This is because most tools cannot distinguish between valid and invalid catch-all emails.\nMany of the business emails from contacts that you prospect in Apollo could have a catch-all domain. This means that when you rely on third-party email verification tools—unless you are willing to invest hours and hours manually verifying which catch-all emails are valid—you will most likely rule out all catch-all emails from your lists. When you do so, you risk losing a big chunk of the potentially qualified company domains in your pipeline.\nHowever, there is a much easier, more accurate alternative. Apollo already includes a built-in email verification process with a 91% email accuracy rate that can differentiate between valid and invalid catch-all emails. This means that you do not need to use a third-party verification tool alongside Apollo. Instead, when you rely upon Apollo's verified emails you know that you automatically include the valid catch-all domains in your sequences and exclude the invalid ones. As a result, you are better equipped to reach more of your ideal contacts without putting your domain reputation at risk.",

Some users were experiencing delays with the enrichment process when their files were very large. So we decided to break down the enrichment process into smaller jobs. Now, Apollo completes CSV enrichment tasks asynchronously. And hey presto, we've improved the efficiency of these larger tasks!",

To ensure full functionality of the Mailgun integration, you need to add a webhook for each domain that you use to send emails from in Apollo. But don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds. Follow the simple steps below, and voila! Like magic, you can start tracking the performance of your sequences and identify bounced emails with accuracy to improve your email deliverability rates.\nNow that you have connected Mailgun, Apollo displays all the domains connected to your Mailgun account.\nClick Add tracking next to each of the domains that you want to connect.\nYou have now added a Mailgun webhook to Apollo.\nYou can delete a connected webhook from Apollo at any time. To do so, click Remove tracking .\n \nMaking Lemonade Outta Lemons!\nPlease note, Apollo only automatically pulls in the list of domains from Mailgun when you first integrate Mailgun with Apollo. This means that if you add or delete a domain in Mailgun, the change does not immediately reflect in the list of domains in Apollo. However, no need to panic! If you make any changes in Mailgun, you can click Refresh List . Apollo then refreshes the list as well as the status of the Mailgun webhook in Apollo.\nIf you try to add or remove a webhook from a domain that no longer exists in Mailgun, Apollo displays an error message.\n \nWhoops!\nDeleted the wrong domain? You'll need to reconnect the domain in Mailgun before you can add the Mailgun webhook in Apollo. For more information about how to add and delete domains in Mailgun, hop into this article in the Mailgun Knowledge Base.\n \nOne Webhook Per Domain\nPlease note, you can only connect 1 webhook per domain with the Apollo<>Mailgun Integration. If you encounter the error below, you can either delete a non-Apollo webhook from Mailgun or manually add the webhook in Mailgun.\nFor more information about how to add or delete webhooks in Mailgun, please refer to the Guide to Using Mailgun Webhooks in the Mailgun Knowledge Base. Alternatively, you can use another domain instead.",

    "body": "There are several key duplication rules to keep in mind before connecting Salesforce.\nWhen you integrate Salesforce with Apollo, Apollo mirrors the data in your Salesforce instance. This means that if you have duplicate leads , contacts , or accounts in Salesforce, these same duplicates reflect in the Apollo platform too.\n \nDouble the Trouble!\nTo avoid duplicate records post sync, you need to ensure that you clean and deduplicate your Salesforce instance before you integrate the 2 platforms. Fail to do so first and you end up with double the workload later, when you have to clean both Apollo and Salesforce instead of just Salesforce.\nIf Apollo pulls a duplicate from Salesforce, Apollo displays a \"potential duplicate\" message on the contact or account 's profile page to notify you. You can also identify the record creation source from the activity log.\nWhen this happens, you need to manually merge the duplicates. For more information on the steps to take, refer to the \" Merge Duplicate Records to Consolidate Your Data \" article. Once you merge a duplicate, Apollo will only continue to sync information of the remaining record with Salesforce.\n \nIt Pays to Be Proactive!\nPlease note, if you pull duplicate records from Salesforce and then merge them in Apollo, Apollo does not merge them in Salesforce. You will need to manually delete or merge the duplicate in Salesforce to prevent the record from syncing again.\nIt is also important to note that when you manually create a duplicate record in Salesforce, Apollo automatically creates the same record in Apollo. Likewise, if you enable the Salesforce \"push\" settings and create a duplicate record in Apollo, Salesforce creates the same record within your Salesforce instance.\n \nManually Created Records\nPlease note, Apollo does not automatically delete or merge the duplicates that you manually create. If you decide to delete or merge any of these records, you must do so manually.",

Now, account stages between HubSpot and Apollo can sink—oops, I mean sync—as well as the best submarine.\n- Apollo had a pesky problem of trying to push enriched account info to Salesforce before the pull from SFDC finishes. We now put the SFDC push operation in the corner until the pull from SFDC completes. Wait your turn, push operation.\n- Contact CSV enrichment was occasionally hanging. We found the perfect remedy. Now, when network errors occur, Apollo resets the job instead of getting stuck in a loop. Let's keep that enrichment train moving.\n- Some SFDC activity logs were not accurately written in Apollo. We taught those logs a lesson and now they're accurate with improved verbiage.",

We upgraded to the latest third party version.\n- Some CSV enrichment reports weren't loading. We reported them for insubordination.

Randomly contacting people is inefficient and won't yield positive results. You need to find a targeted audience.\n- Prospect with LinkedIn\n- It's easy to leverage data from LinkedIn to prospect with the tools Apollo provides. The first thing you should do is search for and request details about prospects from LinkedIn Sales Navigator, LinkedIn, or directly from the Apollo database. Read the \"Prospect in LinkedIn\" article for in-depth instructions.\n- Use the Apollo Chrome Extension\n- The Apollo Chrome Extension works in conjunction with LinkedIn to help you get the data you need to reach your goals. You can prospect contact and account data directly from LinkedIn and complete many tasks through Apollo directly from LinkedIn, such as: request an email address, make a call, and add a saved contact to a list or Sequence . Read the \"Apollo Chrome Extension Overview\" for more information.\n- Create Personas\n-\nPersonas are sets of titles, seniorities, and departments that define different groups of people that you can target within key accounts. This allows you to find contacts faster with Apollo's search tool, receive better recommendations, and improve analytics. You can use Personas to narrow your LinkedIn searches. For more on Personas, read the \"Create a Persona\" article.",

Apollo offers automation tools like Sequences and templates to help you organize and standardize your messaging.\n- Create a Sequence\n- You can leverage the LinkedIn steps capability in the Apollo Sequences feature to organize your messaging and categorize your contacts. For each contact in your Sequence , you can add steps to track interacting in LinkedIn from initial contact to sending a direct message. Apollo reminds you when you should complete different steps in the Sequence to keep you on task. For more information, read the \"Complete a LinkedIn Task in a Sequence\" article.\n \nOh, The Things You Can Do!\nYou can use Apollo Sequences for much more than tracking LinkedIn tasks. Check out the \"\nSequences Overview\n\" and \"\nCreate a Sequence\n\" articles for more information on how sequences are used in Apollo.\n- Draft LinkedIn Messaging\n- You can draft personalized messages through Apollo. Some general best practices for LinkedIn messaging are:\n- Personalize your messages\n- Be direct and keep it short\n- Clearly communicate your goal\n- Suggest ways to meet or speak further\n- Have a clear and concise signature\n- Time your messages during normal business hours\n- You should use the dynamic variables and snippets features in the message template to personalize your messaging at scale.

When you add contacts to the LinkedIn Sequence , Apollo will track each contact through the steps you added to the Sequence . For more on how to add contacts to a Sequence , read the \"\nAdd Contacts to a Sequence\n\" article.\n- Implement Your Sequence\n- You already created your tasks and now you can begin tracking your correspondence with your contacts. Apollo shows you which step a contact is in while they are in a Sequence when you visit their contact card. In this manner, you can track where exactly a contact is in the LinkedIn Sequence .\n- Refine Your Message\n- While you can't A/B test with LinkedIn messaging, you can refine your message to optimize your results. You should always be on the lookout for clearer wording and more personalized messaging to help grab the attention of your potential contacts. Over time, you should develop a comfort level with LinkedIn messaging and your results should improve.\n \nNo Overnight Successes\nPlease note, developing the right messaging strategy takes time and effort.

They help your team deliver communications to your customers and complete the right tasks at the right time to speed your prospects through your pipeline and turn them into paying customers as efficiently as possible.\nAs you use Apollo to hone in on your Ideal Customer Profiles , you can create sequences to match each type of prospect with automatic and manual messages, LinkedIn engagement, calls, and action items that speak directly to the needs and challenges of your target audiences.\nSequence steps are the individual messages and activities you design for your team to successfully engage with prospects. Sequences are made up of as many steps and with as much time between each step as you choose. An ideal outreach campaign requires multiple touches and interactions. You first need to decide upon the type of sales strategy that you want to implement. Is the purpose of your sequence to create demand, to generate pipeline, or to expand upon your existing business? This decision will influence whether you decide to follow an inbound, outbound, nurture-based, event-inspired, upselling, or other sales strategy. Depending on the approach that you choose, the number of steps in your sequence will vary. In most cases, Apollo recommends you follow up with someone at least 5 times.\n \nStep by Step\nFor more information about the types of steps available in Apollo, please refer to the \" Available Steps in a Sequence \" section of the \"Sequences Overview\" article. You can also refer to this section of the \"Craft Killer Sales Email Messaging\" article for 3 example options to consider when planning your sequence strategy.\nWhen you have strategized the number and types of steps to include in your sequence , you are ready to build these steps within Apollo.\n \nIt's Sequence Time!\nFor more information about how to create a sequence in Apollo, refer to the \" Create a Sequence \" article.

    "body": "Several other reasons may impact the delivery of your emails.\nReason\nExplanation\nSolution\nBlocked Contact Stage\nWhen you create a Sequence , you have the option to mark emails as Not Sent when a Contact is in a given Contact Stage . For example:\nIf you try to send an email to a Contact in one of these specified stages, Apollo does not send the email.\nYou can change the stage of a specific Contact that you want to send to or you can change the settings in the Sequence so that Apollo no longer blocks emails to any Contacts in that stage. When you have made this change, try sending the email again.\nBlocked Account Stage\nWhen you create a Sequence , you have the option to mark emails as Not Sent when an Account is in a given Account Stage . For example:\nIf you try to send an email to an Account that is in one of these specified stages, Apollo does not send the email.\nYou can change the stage of a specific Account that you want to send to or you can change the settings in the Sequence so that Apollo no longer blocks emails to any Accounts in that stage. When you have made this change, try sending the email again.\nSame Account Replied\nIf you have set the Sequence Rule to \"not send\" when another Contact from the same Account replies in the Sequence , Apollo does not send the email.\nUpdate the settings in the Sequence Ruleset and try resending the email.\nUnverified Email\nIf this is your first time sending an email to a Contact with an Unverified email, as a failsafe, Apollo does not send the email.\nUnverified emails have a 60-80% success rate. Apollo recommends you try sending the email again.\nMissing Snippet\nIf you included Snippets in a message and the Contact you want to email does not have a value for this Snippet , Apollo does not send the email.\nYou can edit the Contact 's profile to add a value for the missing field. Alternatively, you can change the Snippet to an Advanced Snippet and add a fallback for these types of scenarios. Please refer to the \" Use Advanced Snippets \" article for more information.\nMissing Thread Info\nIf you set the email Type as \"Reply to a Previous Thread\" and the Contact deletes the previous email, Apollo does not send the email.\nThere is no ideal way to solve this issue. You can send this Contact a one-off manual email. Please note, if you want to make sure that the next emails in the Sequence also send, you need to adjust all other emails to send as part of a New Thread .\nNo Send-From Mailbox Selected\nWhen you add Contacts to a Sequence you have to assign a mailbox. If one of your teammates removes a mailbox to which you linked your Contact(s) in the Sequence , Apollo does not send the email.\nYou can update an existing mailbox or choose to link another one.\nFor more information about how to do so, please refer to the \" Update a Linked Mailbox in a Sequence \" article.\nEmail Missing or Invalid\nIf you added a Contact with no email address to your Sequence , Apollo does not send the email.\nUpdate the email address in the Contact's profile.\nWhen the information is up-to-date, resend the message.\nContact Account Not Owned by User\nDepending on your permissions, you may only have access to send emails to the Contacts of which you are the owner. If this is the case and you try to send an email to another user's Contact or Account , Apollo does not send the email.\nYou have 2 options to resolve this issue. Re-assign ownership of the contact or ask an admin to change your permissions so that you can send emails to other users' Contacts and Accounts . For more information, please refer to this section of the \"Create Permission Profiles\" article.\nEmail Service Provider Error\nIf a Contact 's email server is unable to deliver the email and returns an error to Apollo, Apollo cannot send the message.\nThere are many different causes for this type of error. Apollo provides additional information on a case-by-case basis. Hover your mouse over the \"Email Service Provider Error\" in Apollo to find out more. Use this information to troubleshoot the error yourself or reach out to the Apollo Support Team . Please note, the solution may involve making changes on the Contact 's end. If this is the case, there is little Apollo can do to help.\nOther\nApollo uses this final category for emails that did not send but which Apollo cannot group into any of the reasons above.\nContact the Apollo Support Team for further information.",

The Apollo platform helps over 10,000 paying customers and over half a million Apollo users to build and scale their outbound sales systems.

To generate revenue, you need to secure meetings and convert those conversations into sales .\nNot all companies use outbound sales tactics. Some depend primarily on inbound sales and referrals. Although these methodologies have their benefits, they can only take your business so far. Companies that create an effective outbound sales process are able to generate opportunities quickly and repeatedly at scale.\nOutbound sales is a tried and tested tactic for companies in all stages of growth. You may choose to tap into outbound strategies before your product is even live or to generate your first 10 customers. On the other hand, you may use outbound to scale your business from 10 to 200 customers or from 200 to 10,000. The sales strategy you execute should depend on the specific stage in which your business is at. In this Build an Outbound Sales Process course, we will concentrate on the outbound tactics to follow if you want to take your business from 1 to 10 customers or from 10 to 200 customers.",

Before you get started with your outreach, you need to set concrete goals, decide upon the metrics that you wish to use to measure your success, and set a benchmark of comparison from which you can build.\nStart by thinking about:\n- How many accounts and contacts do you wish to engage with\n- How many emails you will send out per day\n- How many touches—or, number of times you engage a prospect—you will include in each sequence\nIf you have run previous campaigns, you can use your historical data as a benchmark of comparison. If this is your first outbound campaign, you can use the sample metrics in this module as a reference so that when you start to gather the results from your new campaigns, you will have quantitative data to measure against your results. There are a number of data points you can focus on. We’d recommend concentrating on the following to begin with:\n- % of email open rates\n- % of replies\n- % of interested contacts\n- The number of meetings set\n- The number of closed/won deals\nStart by drafting out the data points that you want to gather in your own Outbound Sales Metrics table:\nType of Metric\nData Points to Measure\nBenchmark Metrics\nTargeting\n- # Accounts\n- # Contacts/Accounts\n- # Emails/Contacts\n \nActivity\n- # Emails\n \nQuality of Activity\n- % Email Open\n- % Email Reply\n- % Email Interested Rate\n \nResults\n- # Meetings from Email\n \nSales Cycle\n- Meeting —> Win Rate\n- Closed/Won Deals\n \nEach metric you measure will provide you with key insights into the growth and health of your sales strategies.

    "body": "Once you decide upon the number of companies that you want to target—between 100 and 1,000 is a good starting point—you need to decide how many contacts you will target within each account and how many times you will engage with each person. We recommend that you start by contacting at least 2-5 contacts from within the same company and sending at least 2-5 emails to each.\n \nPro Tip!\nMake sure you don’t engage with all of the contacts at the same company at the same time. Instead, try to space out your communications with prospects from the same company across multiple days.\nNow that you know how many accounts you want to target, think about how many emails you should send in a day. A good benchmark for Apollo users is anywhere between 200-500 emails per rep, per day. This provides you with a large enough sample size to analyze the quality of the activity and calculate the conversion rates between opened emails, replies, meetings set, and closed deals.\nYou should also pay close attention to the % email interest rate. This is a key statistic that provides insight into the number of contacts that have confirmed they would like to attend a meeting from the total number of emails you sent out in a month. Using this information, you can then determine the conversion rates per sales rep. Generally speaking, each sales rep should be aiming to secure at least 10-20 meetings per month, but depending on your industry, coaching methods, and approach, one rep could set up as many as 50-100 meetings per month.\nThe more meetings you set, the better chance you have of closing deals. As a benchmark, try to achieve at least a 20%-30% win rate by closing 2-5 deals per month per rep. But always keep in mind that these target metrics are according to the industry average. They give you an idea of the baseline statistics for outbound sales. However, after the first few months of outreach, you should be able to gain a better understanding of what’s possible for your company in your specific market. You can then adapt your sales targets accordingly.",

Each column or Segment in our Product Market Fit Canvas represents a different outreach campaign that we will create in the Apollo platform.\nLet’s take a look at Segment A . Here, we can see that “SMB Startups” are one type of company we should dig into. This description doesn’t give us a specific vertical with which to start. However, it does tell us that we should be looking at companies with fewer than 1000 employees who are also in the early stages of their business. Perhaps they’ve gone through a funding round in the last year or two. Once a company has raised its initial funding and has done two or more rounds of large venture capital or private equity investment, they’re not typically considered a start-up anymore and we can rule out any company that meets that criteria.\nYou might be saying to yourself, ” I’ve got this information—now what? ”\nApollo offers numerous built-in targets to help you find the right people for your outbound campaigns. We have extensive documentation about each filter type available on the Apollo Knowledge Base:\n- Search Filters Overview\n- Settings Filters\n- Person Info Filters\n- Company Info Filters\n- Engagement Activity Filters\n- Created Source Filters\n- Miscellaneous Filters\n- Technologies Filter Options\n- Industry Filter Options\nWe created an Apollo Search with filters that include a pre-defined range of 51-1000 for the number of employees and funding rounds of Seed , Angel , Venture , and Series A .\nThis has given us a total of about 9,000 companies we can dig into. We’ll create a Saved Search for these companies so we can come back to them later.\nNext, we need to utilize what we know about the people who are involved in our closed deals to further refine our search. In the interest of reusability and scalability, we can accomplish this by creating a Persona for Founders at SMB Companies.\nWith our Persona created, we’ll return to the Apollo Search tool and load our Saved Search for SMB Startups .\nWe’ll batch select some of the companies from our list. Then, we’ll click Find People to launch a new Apollo Search for the people who work at the selected companies.\nNow that we have a list of everyone who works at the selected companies, it’s time to apply the Persona that we previously created to find the actual targets for our outreach campaign.\nWe now have a list of real people that match our Product Market Fit Canvas criteria. Since we will want to reach out to these people in a sequence later, we’ll save them to a List so they’re easier to find.\nWe’ll repeat this process for Segment B. This means that we will have two new cohorts that we can reach out to in individualized outreach campaigns.",

These tools, however, do little to help you craft the right messaging to paint your product or service in the right light. This is still largely a manual, hands-on activity that requires careful planning and consideration.\nDespite the fact that there are, to date, no technologies to create an effective email message automatically, there are a number of tried and true methods, structures, and best practices for doing this more effectively.\nIn his article “ How To Write Killer Sales Emails… At Scale ,” Jacco van der Kooij of Winning by Design outlines the Research, Reference, Reward, and Request method—a means of creating winning email messages. We can apply this methodology to our outbound sales process and leverage the tools in the Apollo platform to make sure that we deliver personalized and relevant email messages at scale.",

It is no longer a simple matter of personalizing your outreach with a recipient’s name or company name. Outreach emails also need to be relevant. That means that you need to do your due diligence in trying to find as much information about each contact before you reach out to them.\nLinkedIn and the Apollo database both provide a lot of great information about contacts, but it may be worthwhile for you to dig a little deeper. Search the web for any recent publications that the contact may have. Find out what their alma matter is and what role they currently have. This information helps you to craft a strong opening line and shows your recipient that you have done some research so that your outreach doesn’t feel entirely cold.\nOnce you have completed your research, don’t forget to fill in your Product Market Fit Canvas .

    "body": "Remember, the goal of using the RRRR Method in outreach campaigns is to create a formula for crafting relevant and personalized email messages at scale. The people you are reaching out to are just as busy as you are—they don’t have time and won’t read something that doesn’t immediately grab their attention or apply to them.\nSubject lines are vitally important to grab a potential customer’s attention right away. In fact, 35% of email recipients open an email based on the subject line alone and 69% of email recipients report email as spam based solely on the subject line . In the example below, we’ve used 3 of the 4 components to create our subject line, Research , Reference , and Request .\nThis subject matter makes a clear reference to the content of the email—“Salesforce/Adoption issues.” It also includes a strong call-to-action for the recipient—”Talk on Friday?” If the person who receives this email is a Salesforce user who has had difficulty adopting the platform at their organization, this should at least pique their interest enough to get them to open the email.\n \nKeep it Tight. Keep it Focused.\nThis tried and tested tactic only works if you stay true to the company segments you have built out in your Product Market Fit Canvas . The Reference in your subject line absolutely should match the painpoints for the specific contacts who open it. In the case of our example above, we may have a killer subject line, but if we send a message with the same subject line to non-Salesforce users, we’re fighting a losing battle.\nNext, let’s take a look at how to craft the body of the message. The image below shows a breakdown of how each component should inform the contents of your email.\nHere’s how we applied each of those recommendations to the body copy of our own email message:\nLet’s analyze each individual component. We address the recipient by name; Jennifer. You can easily accomplish this at scale in Apollo with Basic Snippets . Then, we transition to the Research portion of the body copy.\nYour Linkedin profile shows that you led the Salesforce Implementation at Acme.\nHere, we’ve established that we know who we are talking to and what function or responsibilities they hold at their company.\nNext, we move on to the Reference portion of the body copy:\nYour peer at ______ experienced the exact same challenge. I wanted to share a link that shows how he\nsolved the Salesforce Integration that resulted in increased adoption and made their reps\nmore productive.\nIn this part of the body copy, we have likened the pain points experienced by the recipient to a company that they might be familiar with. Additionally, we’ve provided some details around how they addressed these pain points and turned them into a positive. This helps to create rapport with our recipients and demonstrates that they aren’t the only person or business.\nFinally, we move on to the Request portion of the body copy:\nJennifer, is this relevant for you?\nHere, our call-to-action comes in the form of a question. We’ve asked something specifically of our recipient in the hope that she will respond. In this instance, an affirmative answer is just as valuable as a negative one. This is because it allows us to continue the conversation, either specifically with Jennifer or we can follow up again to ask if there is someone else that we should talk to instead. If Jennifer does respond after a few follow-up emails, we may want to shift our focus to someone else in the organization if this account is a strong match for our Product Market Fit Canvas .",

An example might look like this:\n- Value Prop 1 (new thread)\n- \"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\n- Value Prop 2 (new thread)\n- \"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\n- Value Prop 3 (new thread)\n- \"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\nIn this instance, the initial email follows a similar structure to Option A and B and lays out your initial value proposition. The second email in the campaign is a reply to the initial email and follows the “Just following up” email structure. The third email starts a brand new thread and lays out a new set of problems, solutions, and value propositions. Email 4 is a follow-up to the third email thread. Email 5 starts a brand new thread and provides yet another set of problems, solutions, and value propositions. Finally, email 6 concludes with a “Just following up” response to email 5. If at this point, the contact still has not engaged with you, they likely aren’t going to. Our own testing at Apollo has shown that these follow-up emails can be vital to your success. They may even lead you to book 4 times the amount of meetings you might otherwise book.\n \nResources! Resources!

    "body": "“Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” —Samuel Becket\nSales may not have been Samuel Beckett’s vocation, but these 6 simple words certainly resonate with the world of outbound sales. The science of sales analytics boils down to 2 fundamental components: experimentation and testing. What works on one target audience may not work on another. What worked in the past, may not still work in the present. Outbound sales is a fluid process that thrives when you are constantly innovating. If you want to succeed long-term, you need to use the data at your disposal to drive smart decision-making.\nSales analytics provide you with the insights that you need to identify key trends and define what is and isn’t working. You can also use them to decide which tests to run and which improvements to make in order to repeatedly smash your monthly and yearly targets on a consistent basis.\nThere are 4 main facets of effective sales analytics:\n-\nDescriptive Sales Analytics: Study past sales data such as “% Email Open Rate,” “# of Meetings Set,” and the other sales metrics that you decided to track in the module Build an Outbound Sales Process: Metrics , to identify key trends in your current approach.\n-\nDiagnostic Sales Analytics: Deep dive into your sales metrics to draw conclusions as to why outcomes may have happened. Could a sudden increase or decrease in meetings set be due to the time of day or year that you are reaching out? Could a drop in open rates mean that your subject line needs work, or that your domain is at risk? The more you question and analyze your existing approach, the easier it is to replicate your successes and reduce risks.\n-\nPredictive Sales Analytics: Learn from your historical data to make informed predictions about the future results that you can hope to achieve. Are you setting realistic goals based on the data from your current and previous outreach campaigns?\n-\nPrescriptive Sales Analytics: Evaluate all data to draw up a comprehensive plan of action that will help you take the right steps to continue enhancing your outbound sales process. What actions are you going to take to reach the goals you have set and overcome the challenges you may be facing?\nThe first ingredient to successful sales analytics is volume. There is a fine line between too much interaction and too little. When starting out you need a big enough sample size to be able to test different approaches. But you must be careful not to ramp up your efforts too quickly. Do so, and you risk ending up in your contacts’ dreaded SPAM box, with little to show for your efforts except for a sprinkle of regret and a tarnished domain!\nHere are some key sample metrics to aim for when first starting out:\nFunction\nMetric\nBenchmark\nTargeting\n- # Accounts\n- # Contacts per Account\n- # Emails per Contact\n- 100-1000\n- 2-5\n- 2-5\nActivity\n- # Emails\n- 200-500 per day\nQuality of Activity\n- % Email Open Rate\n- % Email Reply Rate\n- % Email Interested Rate\n- 30%-50%\n- 2%-10%\n- 0.2%-2%\nResults\n- # of Meetings Set\n- 20 per month\nWhen you launch your first campaigns, begin by sending 200 emails per day, per rep. This should give you a large enough sample size to start testing different approaches every day without putting your domain reputation at high risk.\n \nSPAM!!!\nWorried about SPAM raining on your parade? Patience you must have, my young padawan. In the next module , we cover this topic in more detail.\nAs you test different approaches with each of your target personas, you can use the open, reply, and interest rates from each sequence as a key indicator to gauge whether or not you are targeting the right contacts and accounts, with the right message, at the right time.\nCheck the results regularly and ask yourself:\n-\nAre you achieving an open rate of at least 30-40%? If not, is your subject line and approach appropriate and relevant to your target audience? Have you considered testing a different target group or trying alternative tactics to gauge more interest from the subject line?\n-\nAre you achieving at least 0.5% email interest rate? If not, have you followed the RRRR messaging approach ? Do your words resonate with your target audience? Did you include a call to action that will encourage a response? Did you align your target with your messaging?\nOnce you start to find your footing and your % interest rate rises above 0.5%, you can gradually start to increase the volume of emails you send out per day.",

    "headings": "Setting the Scene > Avoid Getting SPAM Blocked",
    "heading_id": "toc_3",
    "body": "There is no magic bullet for avoiding SPAM blockers entirely, but there are a few different tactics you can employ to help limit their impact on your outbound email campaigns. If you notice that your email Open Rate has dropped to 10% or lower, SPAM filters are likely blocking your messages before they even reach a contact’s inbox.\n \nEveryone Is Different!\nPlease note, the tips and guidelines below are only meant to serve as best practices and can in no way guarantee that you will eliminate all instances of SPAM blocked emails. SPAM filtering is user-specific—if someone marks an email as spam, their email service provider's spam filtering will update itself to catch similar emails in the future. Two people can receive the same email and encounter different filtering behavior.\nThe following list provides some additional considerations for email body content:\n-\nRemove Links from the Body of Your Email: SPAM filters look for links, especially in first-contact emails. They also scan your signature for links as well. Make sure you've removed links from your signature as well as in the body of your emails.\n-\nRemove Images from the Body of Your Email: Images or attachments, especially in first-contact emails, can activate SPAM blockers and cause bounces. Remove these assets and stick to text. Save your images and attachments for Step 3 or later in your sequence once you've sent a few other emails. As with links, even images in your signature can cause issues.\n-\nDon't Apply Special Formatting to Your Text: Simply put, SPAM blockers scan for formatted text. Avoid using different colors, fonts, bolding, italicization, and underlining.\n-\nKeep Your Paragraphs Concise: Lengthy content can activate SPAM blockers or even cause bounces. Keep your wording simple and to the point.\n-\nAvoid Words that Trigger SPAM Filters: SPAM filters have evolved considerably in the past few years, and as such, there isn't a shortlist of words to avoid. In general, try to communicate in a professional, personable way and avoid words and phrases that sound suspicious, urgent, or needy. This  HubSpot article  provides a comprehensive list of words or phrases that you should avoid. As a best practice, ask yourself if the email you intend to send is one you would want to receive yourself.\n-\nA/B Test Your Messaging: Always test out your messaging to find what results in the highest engagement. You can A/B test in Apollo to try multiple versions of a similar message. If you find one version is blocked at a higher rate, you can look at the differences in your messaging to try to understand the cause.\n-\nInclude an Unsubscribe Link in Your Email Signature: Apollo allows you to use whatever text/phrase you'd prefer in an opt-out link and automatically adds the link with your signature on all of the emails you send through the platform. Research shows that recipients are far more likely to use an unsubscribe link instead of marking your emails as SPAM. Marking your emails as SPAM can affect your overall sending reputation and is, therefore, a much worse outcome.\n-\nDeactivate Click Tracking: Click tracking manipulates links in emails, which SPAM filters can sometimes detect. Disable this feature if you're having issues by deactivating it in each user's profile. For additional information, please see the \" Click Tracking in Apollo \" article.\n-\nDeactivate Open Tracking: T he same technology for open and click tracking is usually very sensitive to filters in email servers. This makes them more susceptible to SPAM blockers. If this is something you've struggled with and you have followed the instructions provided above as best practice, you may want to consider disabling open tracking. For additional information, please see the \" Open Tracking Overview \" article.\nGoogle has a great guide available on their Gmail Help site called “ Prevent mail to Gmail users from being blocked or sent to spam .\" Consider reviewing this if you plan to email Gmail users. We also have extensive technical documentation on the Knowledge Base to provide you with details and techniques to avoid email servers flagging your emails as SPAM or harming your domain reputation.\n- Avoid SPAM Filters\n- Set Up Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to Authenticate Your Emails\n- Set Up Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) to Authenticate Your Email\n- Set Up Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Records to Authorize Your Emails",

    "body": "There may be many different reasons why you move to a new email domain, but all of them require you to build credibility and “warm-up” your domain before you can send out emails en masse.\nEmail delivery services such as Google and Microsoft always monitor the rate at which their users send messages in order to prevent spammers from abusing their services. While they have traditionally only looked at the number of messages their users send per hour and per day, many services are now looking at how many messages users send per minute as well.\nFor example,  Google Suite's hard limits  are 400 emails per hour and 2000 emails per rolling 24-hour period. This means they never allow any of their users to send more than that number of emails via an individual mailbox.\nDomain warming helps you to establish a sending reputation for a domain that is brand new or has not been used to send email in a long time. This process requires you to start with a lower volume of sent emails and gradually increase that volume at each interval (whether that’s a day or a week). To do this, send a reasonable volume of emails with a low amount of bounces and SPAM complaints. Over time, you will develop a better reputation with your email service provider and you can send a higher volume of emails without having your account rate limited or suspended.\n \nRate Limits!?\nIf you are rate limited or suspended by your email service provider, it means that you've sent too much bad content or too many emails per day or hour. You should immediately lower your sending limits in Apollo, edit the content of any emails you're sending that received a high rate of SPAM complaints, and follow any further instructions given by your email provider to get back in their good graces.",

    "body": "Setting up multiple domains for your outbound sales outreach helps to reduce the load on your primary mail server. It also helps to preserve your domain reputation when you need to send a higher volume of emails than your ESP allows.\nFor example, Apollo may send emails from one of the following servers for the same outreach campaign:\n- apollo.io\n- tryapollo.io\n- apollomail.io\nWhite labeling your domain improves your deliverability and Email Service Provider (ESP) reputation. A Sender Policy Framework\n(\nSPF\n) lets you specify the mail servers that you authorize to send emails for your domain and helps to prevent against domain spoofing. This helps your recipients (and more specifically, their ESP) identify potential phishing or fraudulent messages that appear to come from your company. DomainKeys Identified Mail Standard ( DKIM ) is a similar security measure that helps to prevent spammers from impersonating your domain when they reach out to your prospects. You can configure DKIM in your domain provider’s DNS settings to sign your emails with a unique signature that allows a recipient’s server to verify that the sender is really you and that the message was not altered after you sent it.\n \nBlame the Mail Server!\nThe information you need to configure  SPF ,  DMARC , and  DKIM  is specifically related to your own domain and is not in any way related to Apollo. Apollo doesn't have email servers so all emails are sent directly from your email provider. Instructions to configure  SPF ,  DMARC , and  DKIM  vary by domain provider.

If you send a high volume of emails from your email client, you should lower your limits in Apollo.\nWhenever you start a new campaign that includes any kind of A/B testing, you should start with a lower daily volume. After you have data to support your targeting and messaging (typically, Interested Rates that are higher than 0.5% and ideally greater than 1%), you can consider increasing email volume and including more contacts in your outreach.\nGenerally, in the Apollo platform, we advise that you stick with the default mailbox setting of 400 emails per day and 100 per hour. If you want to increase the sending limits, you should do so gradually.\n-\nDaily Limit : Increase by no more than 100 each week until you reach 1500 emails/day. You should never go beyond this limit if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\n-\nHourly Limit : Increase by no more than 20 each week until you reach 400 emails/hour.

However, this may not always be possible, especially when you’re working with hundreds or thousands of potential contacts in a segment.\nAs a rule of thumb, if you’ve got a large segment with hundreds of prospects, using a more automated approach may work best for you—especially if you have a small team with limited resources.

A SVP-Level contact at a Fortunate 500 company is a lot less likely to open (and even less likely to respond) a mass email that is not entirely tailored to their pain points and needs.\nOn the flip side, a manager at an SMB is unlikely to receive as many marketing emails. They may also be more likely to open one that is not entirely tailored to their pain points and needs.\nKeep in mind, you might need to evolve your strategy as you go. Analyze your results on a daily basis to find new patterns to improve your outreach. These are not hard and fast rules. You will need to observe the specific trends of your business to make the most informed decision for your sales strategy.",

It could be due to one of the following reasons:\n-\nThe Apollo sending limit on your account : For more information, please refer to the \" Email Sending Limits Overview \" article.\n-\nYour sequence delivery schedule : For more information, please refer to the \" Create and Edit Sequence Sending Schedules \" article.\n- Unverified emails. For more information, please refer to the \" Email Status Overview \" and \" How do Data Requests Work? \" articles.\nIf the issue persists, please take a look at the \" Why Didn't My Email Send? \" article for further information about all the possible causes for unsent emails.\nOnce you have resolved the issue, here are some best practices to keep in mind for the future:\n- Set your sending limits lower in Apollo to account for any emails you're sending outside of Apollo.\n- Set your hourly limit lower to prevent you from sending too many emails at once.\n- If you want to increase your sending limits, do so in small increments. This is especially important if you have a new domain, as you need some time to build up your reputation. Once your reputation is in good standing, you can send higher volumes of emails with a lower risk of getting flagged as SPAM.\nTo set up your sending limits, follow the steps in the \"Apollo Sending Limits\" section of the Email Sending Limits Overview . Apollo recommends starting with a daily send limit of 400 and an hourly limit of 100. Then, if necessary, you can slowly increase it every week.",

Apollo does this because it is not possible to create or update Opportunity stages through the Salesforce API. The Salesforce Opportunity page is configured as read-only, which means Apollo can only pull this data from Salesforce. Apollo will reflect whatever Opportunity stages you have configured on the Salesforce side.\nWithin the table portion of the Opportunities screen, you can access at a glance details about each Opportunity . By default, Apollo displays the following column headers:\n- Opportunity Name\n- Company\n- Amount\n- Stage\n- Opportunity Owner\n- Created Date\n- Closed Date\nYou can customize the visible data by clicking the Table Column Settings button.\nWithin the \"Columns to Show\" modal, you can add and remove columns from the Opportunities table.

If your account is integrated with Salesforce and the given Opportunity is synced there, then this feed will also list any updates that come from Salesforce. Activities related to an Opportunity can be found in the Activities tab of the account to which the opportunity is linked.\nThe People tab allows you to both view and add contact roles for an Opportunity . Every Opportunity can support multiple contacts, but only one Primary contact.\n \nPeople in Opportunities and Salesforce\nPlease note, removing a person from the people tab in an Opportunity will not remove them from the Opportunity in Salesforce.

To identify your ICP , you need to use measurable data (like company size and industry for B2B or age and gender for B2C) to gather information about the type of business or individual that is best suited to your company offerings. To identify your Personas , you need to use qualitative data (such as pain points, goals, and personality type) to gather information about the kinds of individuals that work for the companies in your Ideal Customer Profile .\nAn ICP helps you to clarify who you sell to, but Personas help you to clarify how you sell to them. Both play an important role in your sales and marketing strategies, but you cannot define Personas without first defining your ICP .\nWithin the context of Apollo, Personas allow you to create sets of titles, seniorities, and departments that define different groups of people that you target within your ICP. Said more simply, they allow you to create filters to find the people at your ideal companies who are most likely to engage with your outreach attempts.\nAnalyze your data to identify the Personas that fit the type of people who you have successfully sold to in the past.

Reasons include:\n- The email address is invalid or non-existent\n- The recipient's email server has blocked the delivery of your email\n- Your domain reputation is so low that your email is SPAM blocked. This means that it won't even reach the SPAM folder\n- Soft Bounce—A temporary issue prevents your email from arriving in the intended inbox. Reasons include:\n- The recipient's email server is busy\n- The recipient's email storage is full\n- The recipient is not accepting emails for a temporary period\n \nWhat Counts as a Bounce?\nPlease note, if your email lands in the recipient's SPAM folder, the recipient can still view the email if they wish to. Therefore, this does not count as a bounce.\nWhen an email hard bounces it can damage your email domain reputation . If you consistently notice a high bounce rate (more than 10%) across all your Apollo Sequences , there could be several potential causes.\nRefer to the section below for more information about each cause and the steps you can take to overcome each one.",

If you send an email to an Apollo-verified contact within 30 days of requesting the details and the email bounces, Apollo refunds your email credit. For more information, please refer to the \" Check Your Email Credit Refunds \" section of the \"What Are Credits?\" article.\nAlthough it may be impossible to eradicate invalid emails entirely from your prospecting workflow, many factors contribute to Apollo's 9% bounce rate. Due to the thorough, tried-and-tested verification process, invalid emails make up a very small portion of that percentage. Other factors include:\n- If the recipient has configured their email settings to block incoming emails\n- If the recipient's mailbox is full\n- If the recipient's server is temporarily unresponsive\n- If you have a negative email domain reputation .\nTo keep track of your sequences in Apollo, make sure you leverage email analytics to monitor email performance and run A/B testing to keep improving your open, click, and response rates. You can also take advantage of the sequence diagnostics tool to pinpoint any issues and learn more about email best practices.\n \nLooking For Email Tips?\nFor inspiration on how to increase your conversion rates, refer to the \" How Do I Write Effective Sales Emails? \" article for a brief introduction.

To identify your Personas , you need to use qualitative data (such as pain points, goals and personality type) to gather information about the kinds of individuals that fall within your Ideal Customer Profile . An ICP helps you to clarify who you sell to, whereas Personas help you to clarify how you sell to them. Both should play an important role in your sales and marketing strategies, but you cannot define your Personas without first defining your ICP .\nOnce you understand your ICP from the inside out, you can better tailor your product or service to address the specific pain points of your Personas . Speak to Customer Support to identify the common questions and characteristics of your long-standing customers. Consult with Customer Success to find out what kinds of accounts are easiest to upsell.

If you stumbled upon this article and you're not sure what a Sequence is or how to add Contacts to one, you may want to check out the \" Sequences Overview \" and \" Add Contacts to a Sequence \" articles for more information about how to get started.\nApollo has a few safeguards in place in the event that you attempt to add Contacts to a Sequence when they are already included in one or more other Sequences . When you add a Contact to a Sequence , Apollo checks for the following criteria:\n- Is the Contact included in any sequence with an Active , Paused , or Failed status?\n- Is the Contact included in any Sequence with a Finished status?\n- Has the Contact recently changed jobs?\n-\nDoes the Contact include a non-verified email address?\nIf Apollo displays the modal above when you add a Contact or Contacts to a Sequence , you have 3 options:\n-\nDo Nothing : You can choose to ignore these warnings and click Sequence Contacts . This will omit any of the Contacts that are included in warnings in this modal and ensure that they are not added to the current Sequence .\n-\nReview Each Warning : You can also expand the accordion for each warning and click the checkbox next to individual Contacts . Apollo adds any Contacts that you check to the Sequence , even if they exist in other Sequences .\n-\nInclude All Contacts : You can choose to include all of the Contacts in each warning category by clicking the checkbox next to it.\n \nWait—Did I Do Something Wrong?\nThere are often real business reasons to add a Contact to multiple Sequences at the same time.

You must use efficiency applications, like Apollo, responsibly to avoid the potential of your provider limiting sending or suspending your account. A suspiciously high number of emails sent in a small period of time can be a red flag for your email provider.\nFor example, Google Suite's hard limits are 400 emails per hour and 2000 emails per rolling 24 hour period. This means they never allow any of their users to send more than that number of emails via an individual mailbox.\n \nSending Reputation\nPlease note, you must develop a sending reputation with your email service provider. To do this, send a reasonable volume of emails with a low amount of bounces and SPAM complaints. Over time, you will develop a better reputation with your email service provider and you can send a higher volume of emails without having your account rate-limited or suspended.\nAny new Gmail account that sends 400 emails per hour or 2000 emails per day will almost certainly get limited or suspended by Google. That amount of activity without a gradual buildup sends a clear message to Gmail's monitoring tools that you likely opened the email account to SPAM people.\nKeep in mind there are many factors that come into play when Google determines your sending reputation and it's always best to play it safe.",

    "body": "Generally, Apollo advises that you stick with the default mailbox setting of 400 emails per day and 100 per hour. If you want to increase the sending limits, you should do so gradually. \n-\nDaily Limit : Increase by no more than 100 each week until you reach 1500 emails/day, which you should never go beyond if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\n-\nHourly Limit : Increase by no more than 20 each week until you reach 400 emails/hour. Never go beyond 400 emails/hour if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\nHere are other additional suggestions you can consider to send more emails as well:\n-\nLink additional mailboxes to users in your Apollo account so each mailbox has its own sending limits. Apollo Professional plan allows you to add up to 2 mailboxes per user, while the Custom plan allows you to link up to 5 mailboxes per user.\n-\nIntegrate with SendGrid via Apollo integrations. SendGrid allows you to send up to 6000 emails per day and 500 emails per hour.\n \nDaily Email Limits\nPlease note, do not set your limits higher than 2000 emails per day. For your first 30 days of sending emails with Apollo, you should not send more than 400 emails per day. If you need to send a higher volume than that, you should integrate with Sendgrid , which is a transactional email service built for even higher-volume sending.\n \nWhy isn't Apollo sending out enough emails to hit my sending limit?\nWhen you try to set a large sending limit through your default ESP without integrating SendGrid, it's possible that your ESP will not allow them to send this quantity of emails. This is because sending limits are set by your ESP and not Apollo. Apollo's configuration is a way to have some control within the platform. ESPs that manage this number natively and typically look to limit how many emails an account can send automatically.",

Apollo's proprietary algorithm calculates intent score based on 3 components:\n-\nFrequency : How often is a company searching for a particular topic with intent? For example, a company triggers 3 signals within the last 3 months.\n-\nTrend : Has there been an upward or downward trend in the search for a particular intent topic over the last 30 days in comparison to the previous 30 days?\n-\nRecency : When was the last time a company searched for the intent topic ? For example, 1 week ago, 1 month ago, 3 months ago, etc.\nApollo considers each of these components when giving the company a score. Apollo then groups them into 1 of 3 categories—high, medium, or low intent.\n-\nHigh : A company triggers at least 4 intent signals in the last 90 days or demonstrates an upward trend with at least 2 intent signals in the last week.\n-\nMedium : A company triggers at least 2 intent signals in the last 90 days and at least 1 intent signal in the last two weeks.\n-\nLow : A company triggers at least 1 intent signal in the last 90 days.\nThe higher a company's overall intent score , the more likely your ideal contacts within the company will engage and convert into paying customers.",

However, please note that Apollo only applies the new Primary email type to the Net New contacts that you request. Apollo does not change the Primary email for any existing saved contacts . This means that you can change your email type with peace of mind, knowing that you won't disrupt the contacts that you have already enrolled in a Sequence .\nIf you are not an admin, you cannot access the Prospecting Config menu. Contact your Apollo system administrator to change your Primary email type.\nTo change your Primary email, launch Apollo, click Settings , and then click Prospecting Config .\nScroll to Primary Email Address .\nYou have 3 options: Business , Personal , or Any .\n \nEmails Galore!\nPlease note, if you select Any , Apollo still sets a contact's business email as the default. However, if Apollo finds both business and personal emails for a contact , you receive both. In this scenario, Apollo only charges you 1 credit for the 2 emails. For more information about email credit charges, please refer to the \" Will Apollo Charge Me For More than One Email Per Contact? \" article.\nClick the radio button for the email type that you want to set as Primary .\n \nMap It Out!\nPlease note, if you integrated your Apollo account with Salesforce or HubSpot, carefully consider which email type you set as Primary . Apollo uses the Primary email when mapping a contact’s data to your CRM. Apollo cannot map secondary emails to a CRM.\nClick Save .\nYou have now updated your Primary email.\n \nA Pinch of Patience!\nPlease note, it can take up to 10 minutes for your new Primary email setting to reflect in your prospecting system. So make yourself a cuppa coffee and before you know it, voila—Apollo will have made the change!",

Hover your mouse over the Boolean Tutorial text for further instructions on how to use Boolean Operators .\nClick the Management Level drop-down and use the checkboxes to select any Seniorities that you want to include in the persona.\nFor further granularity, click the Departments & Job Function drop-down. Then, click the + icon on the right of each item to select specific job functions within each department.\n \nUse a Light Touch With Seniorities, Departments, and Job Functions\nIt’s possible that there may not be data for all of the checkboxes you have selected within a given contact. You may want to avoid using seniorities, departments, and job functions if you have been very specific in the Job Titles field.\nNext, click the Industry & Keywords drop-down and select the relevant industries that you want to include in the persona.\nClick the Advanced settings drop-down if you want to exclude any industries from the persona. You can also apply the industry Is known or Is unknown buttons.\nTo add industry-specific keywords to your persona, click the Company Keywords drop-down and select the keywords that you want to include or exclude.\nNext, click the Location drop-down to include or exclude Contact and Account HQ regions.\nClick the # Employees drop-down and use the checkboxes to select the company sizes that you want to include for this persona.\n \nLess is More\nKeep in mind, the more filters that you apply to your persona, the fewer results you will get when you search for contacts. Only add those that are vital to the persona.\nAs you select each attribute of your persona, Apollo filters the results on the right-hand side of the screen. You can browse through the results and click on a specific contact if you want to take a closer look at their profile page in Apollo.\nWhen you've finished configuring all of the options, click Save Persona .\nYour persona is now ready to use within the Apollo search tool.",

It is the EU’s hypothesis that allowing citizens more control over their digital footprint will foster more trust in online business. This should increase the citizens' likelihood of conducting business with them and thereby increase the digital economy.\nThe regulation went into effect on May 25, 2018, and the potential financial penalties for failure to comply are steep. The sections below provide a high-level overview of important terms, impacts, and how Apollo participates in GDPR.\n \nGDPR Legislation\nIf you would like to read the actual text for the General Data Protection Regulation in its most recent form, please visit EU GDPR website.",

The safest assumption to make is that GDPR affects your company in at least some capacity, especially if you work for a company established in the EU, a company that sells to people within the EU, or a company that monitors the actions of citizens of the EU regardless of where your headquarters is or where you send marketing emails from.\nFailure to adhere to GDPR guidelines can be expensive. The highest amount a single company could pay is 4% of their global annual turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is higher . Lower-tiered fines apply to lower-level penalties and can be the equivalent of 2% of global turnover or 10 million euros.",

If contact information was gained through a third party, the source must be specified at first contact with the Data Subject.\n-\nCross-Border Data Transfer : Sending data and/or personal information outside of EU/EAA borders\n-\nData Subject : A natural person and citizen of the EU whose information has been collected and can be identified by a data controller.\n-\nData Controller : Controllers include parties who manage personal data or collect personal data. Apollo and Apollo's customers are considered data controllers.\n-\nData Portability : A data subject’s right to their own personal data from the data controller in a familiar, machine-readable format\n-\nData Processor : A party that is instructed by the controller in how personal data should be handled and used. Apollo is also considered a data processor.\n-\nData Subject Rights : New rights within the GDPR include the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, and the right to object to profiling.\n-\nGDPR Articles : The GDPR includes two sections—the recitals and the Articles. The Articles include the text of the legislation and the Privacy Management Activities (PMAs) that are required for compliance.\n-\nPersonal Data : Personal data included in Apollo typically includes name, company address, company phone number, email address, and IP address.\n-\nPrivacy by Design and Default : Companies have an obligation to keep data privacy top-of-mind throughout the design process and to build default and adequate privacy controls into all new features.",

    "body": "A key element of the GDPR that can cause business friction is the gravity of consent that is required from individuals. Specifically, in order to collect and handle (or to “process”) personal data of Europeans, marketers, and services like Apollo must have a “legal basis.”\nTwo common legal bases include:\n- Consent of the data subject\n- A “legitimate interest” to use the data that is not outweighed by fundamental “rights and freedoms,” taking into account data subjects’ “reasonable expectations” of how data may be used  \nThe GDPR cites “direct marketing” as an example of a likely “legitimate interest.”\nMany legal commentators have noted that the GDPR leaves many questions unanswered and the potential for courts to resolve those questions in the years to come. Based on the best legal interpretations as of today, Apollo (and many others) believe that under this balancing test, most B2B marketing like newsletters and most direct marketing is protected as a “legitimate interest” if executed in a thoughtful way.\nOn the other hand, campaigns that are not targeted in a way that is likely to be useful to someone given their industry or position may not fit a “legitimate interest.” It will, therefore, be more important than ever for B2B marketers to use data wisely and tailor campaigns and marketing to be relevant.\nThese elements are also only relevant for prospects located in the EU so you don't need to worry about any of these regulations if you’re emailing anyone outside the GDPR’s jurisdiction.",

The Apollo platform is more complex in the way that it handles data than most, so our compliance is similarly complicated.\nOur Privacy Policy and Terms of Service include our Data Processing Addendum . The addendum helps users control what we do with their data and gives them the freedom to access and/or remove their data from our system if they so desire, among other rights.\nMuch of maintaining GDPR compliance as a vendor involves how we secure our data. In order to maintain a high bar of security we have completed the following:\n- Apollo has achieved a SOC 2 and ISO 27001 security accreditation report. These accreditations evaluate Apollo controls that are relevant to data security, availability, and confidentiality. To gain them, Apollo needed to prove the success of our controls and their ability to maintain security, availability, and confidentiality over a predetermined span of time.\n- Apollo has implemented advanced data controls, which include the encryption of all user data, which is designed to protect our customers’ data from leaks and malicious intent. The Apollo team regularly tests our product to fix any potential problems and maintains the industry’s highest standards in information security.\n- Apollo has built and follows data incident response processes. These processes are tested each year for continued effectiveness.\n- Apollo built processes to supplement data recovery and integrity to help any customers whose data is lost or unintentionally corrupted.\n- Apollo has systems in place to protect all customers' rights to their own data footprint in the platform.\n- Apollo’s key data sub-processors, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform, all have achieved similarly high-level security standards (SOC 2 and/or ISO 27001 certifications, where possible) and have undergone rigorous security evaluations.\nGDPR lays out different requirements for “Processors” and “Controllers” of data. In Apollo's case, we operate as both a data controller and data processor since we help our users acquire data as a controller and communicate with prospects as a processor.",

We also view it as our responsibility to educate everyone who uses our data to keep them informed and prepared to use our data in a way that similarly keeps them in compliance.\nOur users have the option of excluding citizens of member countries within the EU to help protect themselves against accidentally emailing someone they shouldn’t. This prevents our customers from having to comb through lists of prospects to double-check their own compliance while prospecting.\nApollo customers that sell or market to EU citizens must be transparent in their intentions with any personal data that they collect and must have consent from individuals before sending them any information. If they do send any form of communication, they must also provide the ability for people to opt out of any future messages. If our customers also use Apollo as their sales engagement platform, they have the ability to include opt-out links within their emails.\nApollo has the ability to enrich data pertaining to citizens of the EU should our users already possess their contact information. For example, if a user has the email address and name of an individual working for L’Oréal Paris, we have the ability to enrich title and company information. With that said, this ability is only applicable if the enrichment is for the purpose of data hygiene and cleanliness or if you have a good faith reason to believe that the recipient has a demonstrated interest in receiving the information or offer, such as information that would help them perform their job.\nAs data controllers, Apollo maintains our own compliance and aids users with their own compliance, but Apollo highly recommends that all of our customers familiarize themselves with the regulations and seek out additional support from privacy advisors if any questions remain.",

If you select this option, all Apollo users within your organization have access to view every other user's email activity. This includes all the emails that Apollo imports from each user's connected mailbox, whether a user sends them through Apollo or not. If you have a large team and are concerned about email confidentiality, Apollo recommends that you select the following checkbox instead: Can see outbound emails sent within the Apollo platform and replies to those emails, but not other emails . This means that users will only see the emails sent and replied to through Apollo. They will not see any other emails from your users' connected mailboxes. And voila—you've kept your team's email privacy safe and sound!",

For example, say you have three custom Picklist fields—one for contacts, one for accounts, and one for opportunities—and they are all named \"Health\".

The steps remain the same.

To do so, click Schedule .\nThen, click the radio button next to your preferred scheduled time or manually select a custom date and time for which you want Apollo to add the contacts to the sequence.\nClick Schedule .\n \nVerified Email Credits\nPlease note, verifying data requires a lot of resources.

Then, scroll through your newly enriched data.\n \nPlaying It Safe\nPlease note, Apollo can only enrich the Salesforce accounts that include a website in the record details. For Salesforce contacts and leads , Apollo can only enrich those that include either an email or the full combination of first name, last name, and company in the record details. Without these identifiers, Apollo cannot reliably match the records in the Apollo database and enrich the contact , lead , or account with confidence. Rest assured that if it’s not reliable, we ain’t wasting your credits!\nIf you try to enrich a record without one of the identifiers mentioned above, Salesforce displays an error message.\nTo overcome the error and enrich the record, click Details on the record page of the lead , contact , or account . Then, click the Edit icon next to the missing field(s).\nEnter the information and click Save .\nThen, click the Apollo tab and click Enrich .\n \nOne Small Step for Security!\nPlease note, if your enrichment request failed the first time or if you have already enriched a record within the last 30 days, you need to manually click the Enrich button after you click the Apollo.io tab to submit the request again. Apollo does not allow you to enrich a contact or lead more than once within a 30-day period. Every credit counts, after all! However, account enrichment does not cost you any credits.

When you request a verified email, Apollo saves the data to your account.\nAt Apollo, verified emails maintain an email match rate of 84% and an accuracy rate of more than 90%. For more information, please read Email Verification: The Apollo Process .\nVerified emails cost 1 credit per contact. \nGuessed\nAn email you have requested that Apollo is unable to fully verify.\nIf Apollo finds multiple pieces of evidence that suggest a probable email, Apollo marks it as guessed and indicates the confidence level. Apollo only returns guessed emails if the confidence level is 50% and above. Please note that guessed emails are more likely to bounce. Apollo recommends you use guessed emails in moderation to protect your domain reputation. For more information about best practices, please refer to the Avoid SPAM Filters article.\nApollo does not charge data credits for guessed emails.\nUser Managed\nAn email that you or your team have manually edited, imported via a CSV file, uploaded from your CRM, or created via the Apollo API.\nThis status filter only applies to the primary email of your saved contacts. Please note that the emails you edit or upload do not count as Apollo-verified emails. If you want Apollo to verify a user-managed email that you have amended or imported, you can choose to enrich the email. For more information about Apollo enrichment, please refer to the Enrich section of the Apollo KB.\nYou can upload new contacts or edit saved emails at no cost. If you want to verify an email you have amended, Apollo charges you 1 credit per contact.\nNew Data Available\nA business email for which Apollo has updates. Apollo identifies when a contact changes jobs and displays the New Data Available status.\nThis status filter only applies to your saved contacts. For more information about job change alerts, refer to the Use Job Change Alerts to Update Contacts article.\nApollo charges 1 credit for every contact update you request.\nN/A\nAn email that Apollo is unable to find or verify. If Apollo finds an email with a confidence score of 50% or less, Apollo marks it as N/A .\nIf you import contacts without email addresses via CRM integration or CSV file, Apollo assigns the contact the N/A status. You can then choose to enrich your contact data with the Apollo Enrichment tool.\nFor more information about Apollo Enrichment, refer to the Enrich section of the Knowledge Base.\nApollo does not charge you any email credits for contacts without known, valid email addresses.\n \nHit the Email Jackpot\nGot your eyes set on particular contacts or personas, but not all their emails display the \"verified\" status? It may be time to raise the stakes! Spread your wings and fly into the realms of guessed emails without taking too high of a risk. You can filter by level of confidence so the chance of bounce stays low. For example, you can choose to only send a message to guessed emails with a confidence level of 90% and above. However, use this secret weapon in moderation to avoid high bounce rates and keep your domain healthy.\nFor more information about how to enable the \"guessed\" email status filter, please refer to the Email Status section of the \"Miscellaneous Filters\" article.",

When the recipient opens this email, this text renders as 2022 .\nNext, the dynamic variable {{now_weekday->plus_2}} tells Apollo to take the current day of the week and advance it by two days. If Apollo sends the email on a Monday, the text in the email renders as Wednesday . If Apollo sends the email on a Tuesday, the text renders as Thursday and so forth. If Apollo sends this email on a Thursday or Friday, the text will render the dynamic variable as Monday because it is the next available weekday.\nSubsequently, the {{now_weekday->plus_3}} dynamic variable tells Apollo to take the current day of the week and advance by three days. If Apollo sends the email on a Tuesday, the text in the email will render as Friday . If Apollo sends the email on a Wednesday, the text renders as Monday . Apollo renders the dynamic variable as the next available work day if the day of the week specified by the dynamic variable falls on a weekend day.\nFinally, the {{now_time_of_day}} dynamic variable tells Apollo to display the time of day for the recipient based on their local time in their local timezone (when it is available) and renders morning , afternoon , or evening .",

Remove these assets and stick to text. Save your images and attachments for Step 3 or later in sequences once you've sent a few other emails. As with links, even images in your signature can cause issues.\n-\nDon't Apply Special Formatting to Your Text : Simply put, SPAM blockers scan for formatted text. Avoid using different colors, fonts, bolding, italicization, and underlining.\n-\nKeep Your Paragraphs Concise : Lengthy content can activate SPAM blockers or even cause bounces. Keep your wording simple and to the point.\n-\nAvoid Words that Trigger SPAM Filters : SPAM filters have evolved considerably in the past few years, and as such, there isn't a shortlist of words to avoid. In general, try to communicate in a professional, personable way and avoid words and phrases that sound suspicious, urgent, or needy. This HubSpot article provides a comprehensive list of words or phrases that you should avoid. As a best practice, ask yourself if the email you intend to send is one you would want to receive yourself.\n-\nA/B Test Your Messaging : Always test out your messaging to find what results in the highest engagement. You can A/B test in Apollo to try multiple versions of a similar message. If you find one version is blocked at a higher rate, you can look at the differences in your messaging to try to understand the cause.",

Research shows that recipients are far more likely to use an unsubscribe link instead of marking your emails as SPAM. Marking your emails as SPAM can affect your overall sending reputation and is, therefore, a much worse outcome.\n-\nDeactivate Click Tracking : Click tracking manipulates links in emails, which SPAM filters can sometimes detect. Disable this feature if you're having issues by deactivating it in each user's profile. For additional information, please see the \" Click Tracking in Apollo \" article.\n-\nUpdate Apollo Send Limits in the app. Head to Settings , click You , and then click the Mailboxes tab. Click the appropriate mailbox and amend the sending limits in the daily/hourly fields.\n-\nDeactivate Open Tracking : The same technology for open and click tracking is usually very sensitive to filters in email servers. This makes them more susceptible to SPAM blockers. If this is something you've struggled with and you have followed the instructions provided above as best practice, you may want to consider disabling open tracking.

Apollo updates the contact to the \"interested\" stage automatically if your contact's email is detected in a Gmail calendar invitation. This only works when you have your Gmail account linked and you use Google Calendar.\nNot Interested\nThe contact responded that they are not interested. You can try to re-engage with the contact at a later date if they fit your buyer profile.\nUnresponsive\nApollo marks a contact as \"unresponsive\" if they never reply or engage with your messaging. If you want to amend the default number of days in which Apollo marks a contact as unresponsive, refer to the Create Sequence Rulesets article. You may want to re-engage with these leads every 30-90 days, as different positioning, more education about your product, a change in a contact's role, or better timing could still lead to a sale.\nDo Not Contact\nApollo automatically assigns a contact to the Do Not Contact stage if a contact actively unsubscribes from your emails. You can also configure contact triggers in the settings if you want to set up additional automation. For one-off cases, such as when a contact personally requests for you to stop reaching out, or for competitors, you can manually assign saved contacts to the Do Not Contact stage from the search page.\nBad Data\nThe prospect's email bounced because the email was incorrect.\nChanged Job\nApollo informs you when a contact changes jobs so you can email them as they settle into their new role.",

This is because the Emails tab shows stats relative to the emails themselves, rather than the contacts who were emailed. The Overview tab shows stats relative to those contacts. It's possible to deliver more than one message to a contact in a sequence and this explains the discrepancy.\n\"Email Tracking\" statistics are available on the righthand side of the sequence screen.\n \nClick for Additional Details\nPlease note, clicking on an individual statistic will bring you to the relevant stage in your sequence's Emails tab.\n\"Email Tracking\" statistics provide the following data points:\n-\nScheduled : The total number of contacts currently scheduled to receive a message in the sequence\n-\nDelivered : The total number of contacts who have been delivered at least one message in the sequence\n-\nOpen : The total number of contacts who have opened at least one message in the sequence\n-\nClick : The total number of contacts who have clicked at least one link in the sequence's messages\n-\nReply : The total number of contacts who have replied to at least one of the sequence's messages\n-\nInterested : The total number of contacts who were marked as interested after receiving one of the sequence's messages, or accepting a calendar invite\n-\nOpt out : The total number of contacts who have clicked an opt-out (unsubscribe) link in one of the sequence's messages\nAggregate statistics are determined by the total number of emails delivered in the sequence. The overall sequence percentages are calculated by dividing by the total number of emails delivered. When you hover your mouse over the percentages, you will then see the numerical count for that stat.\nIn the example above, the 82.2% open rate for the sequence is determined by the total number of open emails (106) divided by the total number of delivered emails (129). Email stats in individual sequence steps are calculated the same way as the aggregate—dividing by the total number of emails delivered for that one message.\n \nWhere is My Mind...er...Data?\nPlease note, if you delete contacts from your account, Apollo reflects this change in the statistics header under the \"Emails\" tab.\nApollo deletes the records of any emails that you sent to the deleted contacts; however, the “Overview” tab still displays statistics for every email that you have sent since you activated the sequence.",

This can trigger an open event without the recipient ever reading the email. It is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is possible.\n- On mobile, the Gmail app displays the email on a preview screen.\n- This sometimes triggers an email open event without the user seeing more than just the subject and first few words.\nOn the other hand, false negatives are also possible. This occurs when a contact opened your email and the tracking pixel was not downloaded so it did not trigger an open event. If your contact has set their email to not download images automatically, you may get incomplete data.\nThe easiest way to combat this and improve your open data is to include a clickable link in your email. This ensures that anyone who clicked your link opened and reads your message.",

If you have a custom plan, you may make calls within the United States and internationally (pending approval). Apollo provides 3 minutes of international dialing time per dollar spent on your custom subscription.\nApollo counts your talk time by the second and not by the minute.

For additional information about how to configure the dialer for international phone numbers, refer to \" Get a New Phone Number (International) \" section of the \" Configure the Dialer \" article.\nDue to regulatory and residency requirements in other countries, Apollo currently supports these countries:\n- Argentina (AR)\n- Australia (AU)\n- Austria (AT)\n- Bangladesh (BD)\n- Barbados (BB)\n- Belgium (BE)\n- Brazil (BR)\n- Bulgaria (BG)\n- Chile (CL)\n- Colombia (CO)\n- Croatia (HR)\n- Czech Republic (CZ)\n- Denmark (DK)\n- Dominican Republic (DO)\n- Ecuador (EC)\n- El Salvador(SV)\n- Estonia (EE)\n- Finland (FI)\n- France (FR)\n- Germany (DE)\n- Greece (GR)\n- Grenada (GD)\n- Hong Kong(HK)\n- Hungary (HU)\n- Indonesia (ID)\n- Ireland (IE)\n- Italy (IT)\n- Jamaica (JM)\n- Japan (JP)\n- Kenya (KE)\n- Malaysia (MY)\n- Mali (ML)\n- Mexico (MX)\n- Netherlands (NL)\n- Norway (NO)\n- New Zealand (NZ)\n- Nicaragua (NI)\n- Panama (PA)\n- Philippines (PH)\n- Portugal (PT)\n- Romania (RO)\n- Singapore (SG)\n- South Africa (ZA)\n- Spain (ES)\n- Sweden (SE)\n- Switzerland (CH)\n- Thailand (TH)\n- United Kingdom (GB)\n \nManaging Minutes Like a Boss\nTo keep track of your team’s talk time, click Settings and then click Manage Plan .
